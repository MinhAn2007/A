# Galaxy Heart Demo

## Overview
The Galaxy Heart project is a visual demo that showcases a dynamic particle system rendered on an HTML canvas. The particles initially appear in a galaxy-like formation, gather into a heart shape, and then explode after 1 to 2 seconds. Users can interact with the demo by adjusting various parameters such as particle count, spin, spread, and glow.

## Features
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can modify the number of particles, their spin, spread, and glow through an intuitive UI.
- **Dynamic Particle Behavior**: Particles gather into a heart shape and explode, creating a visually appealing effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The canvas adjusts to the window size for optimal viewing.
